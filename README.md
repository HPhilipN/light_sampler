# light_sampler
    
    The goal of this project is to sample varying light levels using a photoresistor, process and analyze the data, and display the data onto a 8x8 LED matrix. 





    The method of data transfer that I'm using will be UDP, in this case, we're getting a constant stream of light data so we want to use a protocal that is relatively fast and efficient.
